This sub-task focuses on modeling the diesase spread. Specifically, here we want to forecast the number of cases, critical care beds used, and deaths at different level of geographic granularity. We also want to explore what features the model considers important to predicting these in order to provide insights.

## Critical Care Forecasting

Our second sub-task focuses on utilizing critical care data to forecasting patient length of stay, risk of decompensation, and overall mortality at each time step in their medical record charting events.
